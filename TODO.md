# TODO
* Configure color styles (for black and white terminal)
* Do not show the authored new PRs as new, mark them as read automatically.
* Show help with ctrl-h
* Optionally open /files url
* BUG - opening default-mute causes unmute. Maybe solve it by adding state for each new file and default mute there?
